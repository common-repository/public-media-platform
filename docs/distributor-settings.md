# Distribution Plugin and Settings

The PMP Distribution plugin adds to the main WordPress PMP plugin by allowing you to set a default Distributor for content you push to the PMP. This is useful for content projects involving multiple producers, for example a Regional Journalism Collaboration where each producer is contributing to a pool of content. 

Begin by selecting a default Distributor in the **Distributor Settings** panel:

Now when you push content from WordPress to the Public Media Platform, it will be associated with the GUID for that Distributor. While you retain ownership of the content, the Distributor can pull all content assigned to it for further distribution.

As with Groups, Series, and Properties, you can change the Distributor from the default for any post in the PMP Distribution Options panel. 

Note that you can only push content you create to the PMP.
