# Managing PMP Properties

Properties are defined in the PMP as the highest level of organization for a collection of content. It could be akin to a brand for a broadcast program, or an entire news organization. (See the [Terminology section of the PMP User Docs](https://support.pmp.io/guides#pmp-terminology) for more on what a Property is in the PMP.)

Like Series and Groups, you can create new Properties in the PMP plugin and add tags to them, and they will propagate to the PMP. You can modify the title and tags of a property in the plugin, and this will update the PMP. You canâ€™t delete properties in the PMP plugin once they are created, but you can modify them to suit your needs.

To manage properties, navigate to **Public Media Platform** > **Properties** in the WordPress dashboard.

Create a new property by clicking the **Create new properties** button, then enter a Title for the property and any relevant tags:

## Setting the Default Property

To set the default property to which all new content pushed to PMP will be added, click the "Set as default" link below the series of your choice.

You will asked to confirm your choice:

After clicking "Yes" to confirm, the confirmation prompt will close and the list of series will update. The property you set as the default will appear with "(default)" near its name:
